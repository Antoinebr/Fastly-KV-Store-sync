### üõ† How it works
	‚Ä¢	Data is stored in a Fastly KVStore named pokemons.
	‚Ä¢	The API reads JSON entries from this store and returns them via HTTP.
	‚Ä¢	It uses Fastly‚Äôs Express-like framework @fastly/expressly for route handling.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
	‚Ä¢	Pok√©mon names are case-sensitive in the current implementation.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure entries in pokemons KVStore are stored as valid JSON strings.
